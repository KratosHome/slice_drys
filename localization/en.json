    "description": "not just a business, but a family tradition rooted in the heritage of our ancestors. It all began several generations ago when our great-grandparents dried meat, fruits, and vegetables for the winter to preserve their flavor and nutritional value. Even then, we realized that natural products are the best gift you can give to your loved ones. In those days, the whole family would gather around the table, always accompanied by aromatic dried treats, crafted with love and meticulous attention to detail.",
